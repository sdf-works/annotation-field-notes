# Annotation Field Notes

A living notebook of insights from real-world AI evaluation work, including multimodal annotation, RLHF-style feedback, behavioral critique, and early signs of model drift.

This is not a polished white-paper repository (yet).  
These are *field notes*:  observations, strategies, patterns, and weird failures that reveal how models think — and where they break.

Annotators are the first people to see how AI actually behaves. I think about those moments constantly.

These are my field notes from the frontier: the weird failures, the structural patterns, and the insights hiding in the uncanny seams of model behavior.

## Why this exists
AI systems don’t fail randomly.  
They fail along predictable seams:  
- epistemic drift  
- brittle reasoning  
- false visual anchors  
- inconsistent temporal logic  
- overconfident hallucination  
- reward-misaligned behavior  

Annotators are the first people to see those seams.  
This repo documents what shows up in the trenches.

## Topics
- Multimodal failures and uncanny model behavior  
- Drift detection and why hallucination is a symptom, not the root cause  
- How to evaluate model reasoning, not just correctness  
- Patterns in unsafe or incoherent outputs  
- Notes on RLHF practice from inside annotation tasks  
- Conceptual frameworks for safer, more aware AI systems

## Long-term goal
These notes will evolve into a series of short essays and white papers on:
- model drift awareness  
- uncertainty signaling  
- edge-case detection  
- interpretability through behavior  
- multimodal cognitive seams
